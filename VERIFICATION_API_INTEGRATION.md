# 🔌 Verification System API Integration

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** 2025-01-28

---

## 📋 Overview

The verification system includes **English proficiency** and **skills (coding) tests** only. Identity verification (Smile Identity / Dojah) has been removed.

**Verification flow:**
1. **English proficiency test** — 30% of overall score
2. **Skills test** (coding/MCQ/portfolio) — 70% of overall score

**Minimum requirement:** Freelancers must score **at least 50% in both** English and skills. If either score is below 50%, the freelancer sees a message and their account is **automatically deleted** from the platform.

## ✅ Implemented Integrations

### **1. OpenAI GPT-4 Integration** ✅

**Purpose:** Grade written English responses for the English proficiency test

**Configuration:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
Set in Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables.

**Usage:** Action `gradeWrittenResponse`; updates `writtenResponseScore` in the vetting result.

---

### **2. Judge0 Integration** ✅

**Purpose:** Execute coding challenges for skill assessments

**Configuration:**
- **Direct Judge0** (ce.judge0.com or api.judge0.com): use `X-Auth-Token` (set `JUDGE0_API_KEY`).
- **RapidAPI**: use `JUDGE0_RAPIDAPI_KEY` and `JUDGE0_RAPIDAPI_HOST`.

```bash
# Direct Judge0 (Judge0 CE or official) — auth header: X-Auth-Token
JUDGE0_API_URL=https://ce.judge0.com
JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_auth_token

# OR RapidAPI:
JUDGE0_API_URL=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
JUDGE0_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
JUDGE0_RAPIDAPI_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
```

When `wait=true` is not supported (e.g. official api.judge0.com), the integration automatically submits without wait and polls for the result.

**Usage:** Action `executeCodingChallenge`; used by skill assessments.

## 📊 Scoring

- **Overall score** = English × 30% + Skills average × 70%
- **Minimum 50%** required in **both** English and skills
- If English &lt; 50% **or** skills average &lt; 50%: account is deleted and user is shown a message

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- **OpenAI:** Fallback scoring algorithm if API fails
- **Judge0:** Errors and timeouts are caught and reported per test case

## 🔒 Security

- API keys stored in Convex environment variables only
- No identity verification providers; no document/selfie handling
